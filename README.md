# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
# To-Do Application

A simple To-Do application built using React.js and Tailwind CSS, allowing users to manage tasks by organizing them into categories, drag and drop tasks between categories, add new tasks, and delete existing tasks. The application stores tasks locally using the browser's localStorage, ensuring that tasks persist even after the browser is closed.



## Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Easily move tasks between categories by dragging and dropping them.
- **Add Tasks**: Add new tasks to any category.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks from the list.
- **Local Storage**: Tasks are stored locally in the browser's localStorage, ensuring persistence across sessions.

## Technologies Used

- React.js
- Tailwind CSS
